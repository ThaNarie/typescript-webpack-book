# Using type defiintions from libraries

This section will explain how to use type definitions from some specific libraries. The libraries that are covered are used by me in various projects to give hands-on information. The list will grow when I will use more libraries.

Besides typing the method and properties that a library exports, often they also add 'generic' type support. Especially in functional and dynamic typed libraries like redux, most types are generic. Those functions can have a dynamic amount of input variables, and the output type can be based on the input.
